# Weather Monitoring Application

The weather station will be based on WeatherData object, which tracks current weather conditions
(temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure), We will create an application that initially provides two display elements: current conditions and heat index, all updated in real time as the  WeatherData object acquires the most recent measurements.

P.S: example from Head First Design Patterns Book
